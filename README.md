# YouTube Marketing Analysis: Finding the Best UK YouTubers to Partner With

**The Big Question**: Which YouTube creators should our company work with to get the best bang for our buck?

## What This Project Is About

I got asked by our marketing boss to figure out which YouTubers in the UK would be worth partnering with for our 2024 campaigns. Instead of just guessing, I decided to crunch the numbers and find out who actually delivers results.

Think of it like this: if you're going to spend money on advertising, wouldn't you want to know which option gives you the most customers for your dollar?

## The Dashboard I Made

I created an interactive dashboard that lets you:
- See all the YouTubers ranked by different metrics
- Visualize the data with charts and graphs
- Calculate potential profits for different scenarios
- Filter and sort the data however you want

Think of it as a control panel that makes all this data easy to understand at a glance.

## The Data I Used

I found a dataset on Kaggle (a website where people share data) that listed the top 100 UK YouTubers in 2024. It had the basic info I needed:
- How many people subscribe to each channel
- How many total views they get
- How many videos they've posted

It's like having a report card for each YouTuber showing their popularity stats.

## My Toolkit

| What I Used | Why I Used It |
|-------------|---------------|
| Excel | To first look at the data and understand what I was working with |
| SQL (Database software) | To clean up messy data and do calculations |
| Power BI | To make charts and graphs that look professional |
| GitHub | To keep track of my work and share it |

## How I Did The Analysis

### Step 1: Cleaning Up The Messy Data
The original data wasn't perfect. Some problems I fixed:
- Channel names were mixed up with other info - had to separate them out
- Some text was in different languages
- There was extra information I didn't need

Think of it like organizing a messy spreadsheet before you can actually use it.

### Step 2: Making Sure The Data Was Good
I double-checked everything:
- Made sure I had exactly 100 YouTuber records
- Verified all the numbers made sense
- Checked there were no duplicate entries

### Step 3: Asking The Right Questions
I focused on 6 key questions that would help make business decisions:
1. Who has the most subscribers?
2. Who posts the most videos?
3. Who gets the most total views?
4. Who gets the most views per video on average?
5. Who has the best view-to-subscriber ratio?
6. Who has the most engaged audience?

## What I Found Out

### The Top Players

**Most Popular (by subscribers)**
- NoCopyrightSounds: 33.6 million subscribers
- DanTDM: 28.6 million subscribers  
- Dan Rhodes: 26.5 million subscribers

**Most Watched Overall**
- DanTDM: 19.78 billion total views
- Dan Rhodes: 18.56 billion total views
- Mister Max: 15.97 billion total views

**Most Active (posts most videos)**
- GRM Daily: 14,696 videos posted
- Manchester City: 8,248 videos posted
- Yogscast: 6,435 videos posted

## The Money Part: Which Partnerships Make Sense?

Here's where it gets interesting. I calculated how much money we could potentially make from three different types of partnerships:

### Option 1: Product Placement (Putting our product in their videos)
**My assumptions**: Our product costs $5, and 2% of viewers might buy it

| YouTuber | Average Views Per Video | Potential Profit Per Video |
|----------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Dan Rhodes | 11.15 million | **$1,065,000** |
| NoCopyrightSounds | 6.92 million | $642,000 |
| DanTDM | 5.34 million | $484,000 |

### Option 2: Sponsored Video Series (They make multiple videos about us)
**My assumptions**: We pay for 11 videos at $5,000 each

| YouTuber | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Yogscast | Small profit of $16,000 |
| GRM Daily | Loss of $4,000 |
| Manchester City | Loss of $31,000 |

### Option 3: Brand Ambassador Deal (3-month contract)
**My assumptions**: We pay $130,000 for a 3-month partnership

| YouTuber | Potential Profit |
|----------|-----------------|
| Mister Max | **$1,276,000** |
| Dan Rhodes | $985,000 |
| DanTDM | $404,000 |

## My Recommendation

**Work with Dan Rhodes first**. Here's why:
- He's consistently in the top 3 across multiple categories
- Good return on investment no matter which strategy we choose
- Has a solid, engaged audience
- Not the absolute biggest, but reliable and profitable

**My suggested plan**:
1. Start with one collaboration with Dan Rhodes to test the waters
2. If it goes well, expand to work with DanTDM and Mister Max
3. Keep track of how many people actually buy our product
4. Adjust our strategy based on what actually works



## Why This Matters

Instead of just picking YouTubers because they seem popular, this analysis gives us actual numbers to base decisions on. We can see:
- Who gives us the best return on our marketing investment
- Which type of partnership strategy works best
- How to minimize risk while maximizing profit

## A Reality Check

These numbers are estimates based on assumptions (like our 2% conversion rate). In real life, results might be different depending on:
- How well our product fits with their audience
- How good our marketing content actually is
- Market conditions and timing
- Competition from other brands

But having data-driven estimates is way better than just guessing.
